To use the run.sh script both CPTESTING and GEOSERVER environment variables
should be defined. CPTESTING define the URL to download the cptesting requests
and GEOSERVER is the URL of your WFS Server. 

For instance, you may use the following:

export CPTESTING=http://localhost/cptesting/requests/
export GEOSERVER=http://localhost:8082/geoserver/ows

Please use the following syntaxe:

  ./run.sh <WPSInstance> <ServiceNames> <RequestTypes> <Requests> <Concurents>

where <WPSInstance> should be the url to a WPS Server and <ServiceName> should 
be the service name you want to run tests with, <RequestTypes> the types of 
requests you want to test, <Requests> is the number of requests to run during
the performance tests and <Concurents> is the number of concurrent requests to 
send.

For instance to test the Buffer service on a localhost WPS server, using the
GetCapabilties tests, run performance testing using 5000 requests with 100 
concurents use the following command:

  ./run.sh http://localhost/cgi-bin/zoo_loader.cgi Buffer GetCapabilities 5000 100


Important note:  sometimes XML validation failed because xmllint is unable to download
a file required to validate. In such case, you can use the file /etc/xml/catalog on your
local machine to use a local copy of the missing file.

For instance, in case xml.xsd can't be downloaded, then you can download a copy using
this url http://www.w3.org/2001/xml.xsd, store it in /etc/schemas directory and then 
use the following /etc/xml/catalog file:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE catalog PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD Entity Resolution XML Catalog V1.0//EN" "http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/entity/release/1.0/catalog.dtd">
<catalog xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:entity:xmlns:xml:catalog">
<rewriteSystem systemIdStartString="http://www.w3.org/2001/xml.xsd"
                rewritePrefix="file:///etc/schemas/xml.xsd" />
</catalog>

Obviously, you can do similar manipulation for the OGC schemas to use local files 
rather than downloading them for each tests.
